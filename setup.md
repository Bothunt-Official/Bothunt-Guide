# Webhook Setup

Submit a webhook URL in your botâ€™s settings. After that, generate an authentication token from the same page. This token is included in the Authorization header of every request sent to your endpoint.

:::info
Authentication token is `null` by default. The backend ignores all events if no token is available.

## Responses

- The API expects an HTTP `200` response indicating a successful delivery. 
- Requests receiving a `4xx` response are immediately discarded.
- Requests receiving a `5xx` response are queued again and retried.

## Retries

Each request is retried up to 10 times with an exponential backoff of `2^N` seconds.
